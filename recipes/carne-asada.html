        <li>200g of Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First gotta fire the grill and wait until there is not fire anymore, while you wait for the fair to chill you do step 2</li>
        <li>Spread the tomahawk with a lot of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>When there is no more fire and only the blazes are keeping the temperature you put the tomahawk into the grill</li>
        <li>In order to seal the meat you have to keep the tomahawk maximum 30 seconds on each side (up-front, down, left, right, front and the back)</li>
        <li>After that you have to cook again all the sides keeping the meat 2 to 3 minutes per side</li>
        <li>Make sure that the fat of the meat does not fire up the blazes and also make sure to keep a good temperature with a fan to air out the blazes</li>
        <li>Peal and mince the Garlic very thinly </li>
        <li>Put the butter to melt in a metal bowl and then add the garlic</li>
        <li>Mix the garlic and butter</li>
        <li>Checkout how cooked the meat is using a knife and when you get your favorite term move the meat away from the blazes</li>
        <li>Shower the meat with the melted butter </li>
        <li>Slice the meat in chunks of 1-2cm</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
